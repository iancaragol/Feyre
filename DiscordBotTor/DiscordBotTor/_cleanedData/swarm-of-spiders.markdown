***Spider Climb.*** The swarm can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Web Sense.*** While in contact with a web, the swarm knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

***Web Walker.*** The swarm ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

**Actions**

***Bites.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. Hit: 10 (4d4) piercing damage, or 5 (2d4) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.

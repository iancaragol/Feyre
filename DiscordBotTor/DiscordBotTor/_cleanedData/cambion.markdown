***Fiendish Blessing.*** The AC of the cambion includes its Charisma bonus.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The cambion's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). The cambion can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: 

3/day each: alter self, command, detect magic

1/day: plane shift (self only)

**Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The cambion makes two melee attacks or uses its Fire Ray twice.

***Spear.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft ., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.

***Fire Ray.*** Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) fire damage.

***Fiendish Charm.*** One humanoid the cambion can see within 30 ft. of it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 day. The charmed target obeys the cambion's spoken commands. If the target suffers any harm from the cambion or another creature or receives a suicidal command from the cambion, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful, or if the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the cambion's Fiendish Charm for the next 24 hours.

2/day each: darkness, dispel magic

1/day: cloudkill

***Magic Resistance.*** The mezzoloth has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The mezzoloth's weapon attacks are magical.

**Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The mezzoloth makes two attacks: one with its claws and one with its trident.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage.

***Trident.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage when held with two claws and used to make a melee attack.

***Teleport.*** The mezzoloth magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

***Variant: Summon Yugoloth (1/Day).*** The yugoloth attempts a magical summoning.

A mezzoloth has a 30 percent chance of summoning one mezzoloth.

A summoned yugoloth appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, does as it pleases, and can't summon other yugoloths. The summoned yugoloth remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner takes a bonus action to dismiss it.

***Grappler***
*(PH)  Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher*

**You’ve developed the skills necessary to hold your own in close-quarters grappling. You gain the following benefits:**
• You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling.
• You can use your action to try to pin a creature grappled by you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature are both restrained until the grapple ends.
• Creatures that are one size larger than you don’t automatically succeed on checks to escape your grapple.

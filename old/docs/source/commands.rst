Feyre has a rich set of commands to help you play role-playing games in discord.

.. _Help:

Help
====

``!help``

!help lists all of Feyre's commands and any important updates or information. Instead of referring to this page you can always use the !help command.

**Learn More About a Command**

``!help [command]``

If you need more information on how a command works you can use !help like this::

    !help init

.. _Dice-Rolling:

Dice Rolls
==========

``!roll [dice expression]`` *or* ``!r [dice expression]``

!roll can be used to roll dice of any size with complicated expressions and built in skill checks.

Dice are represented with the standard [# of dice]d[size of dice] format. You can also use !r::

    !roll 4d6
    !roll 1d6*2
    !r 1d20 + 5
    !r 1d1000 + 2d2000 * 3 / 3 - 1

**Skill Checks**

Skill checks can be built into the dice expression using the < and > symbols::

    !roll 1d20 > 15

**Advantage & Disadvantage**

You can roll with advantage or disadvantage using the -a and -d flags before the dice expression::

    !roll -a 1d20
    !roll -d 1d20+5

Finally, you can reroll any dice roll by clicing the reroll emoji.

**Rolling a single die**

``!d[size] [expression]``

!d[size] [expression] can be used if you only want to roll one dice. If you only need to roll one dice this command is quicker than typing !roll.

This command supports standard dice sizes [4,6,8,10,12,20] and expressions. A space is necessary between the dice and any modifiers.

You can also use !dp to roll for percentile::

    !d20
    !d6 +2
    !dp

.. _GM-Rolling:

Secret Dice Rolls
=================

``!gm``
``!gm roll [expression]``

!gm can be used to send dice rolls to the GM without other players being able to see the result. This is helpful in cases where a player needs to make a roll without the rest of the parties knowing.
GM's are set on a per channel basis.

**Setting the GM**

``!gm``

!gm sets the channels GM to the user. Any further rolls using the !gm command will be DM'd to the roller and the GM.

``!gm roll [dice expression]``

If the channel has a GM then this will roll [dice expression] and direct message the result to the user and the GM for that channel.

Example::

    !gm
    !gm roll 1d20-5




.. _Initiative-Tracker:

Initiative Tracker

!currency can be used to convert any denomination of platinum, gold, electrum, silver, and copper to gold, silver and copper.

* gp = Gold
* ep = Electrum
* sp = Silver
* cp = Copper

When providing the amounts there is no need to worry about capitlization or spacing.

**Convert Currency to GP, SP, CP**

For example, convert 177 ep, 112 sp, 43 cp to gp, sp, cp::

    !currency 117ep112sp43cp

**Divide Currency Amongst Players**

    !currency 111gp37sp4cp/4


.. _Bank:

Bank
====

``!bank``

You can use Feyre to manage all of your character's wallets. Your bank is tied to your Discord ID and can be accessed from any server/channel or by direct messaging Feyre.

Interacting with your bank requires the use of argument flags (-a, -r, -d, -w). If you have any suggestions on how this experience can be streamlined please use the !request command and let me know!

[currency values] have the same format as the :ref:`Currency` command. For example you can represent 10 platinum, 9 gold, 8 electrum, 7 silver, and 6 copper like this: 10pp9gp8ep7sp6cp

*This feature will eventually be combined with* :ref:`Character`.

    !bank -d Bilbo 10sp5cp

See all of your characters and their unique IDs::

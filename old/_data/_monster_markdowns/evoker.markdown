***Spellcasting.*** The evoker is a 12th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). The evoker has the following wizard spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): fire bolt*, light*, prestidigitation, ray of frost*

1st level (4 slots): burning hands*, mage armor, magic missile*

2nd level (3 slots): mirror image, misty step, shatter*

3rd level (3 slots): counterspell, fireball*, lightning bolt*

4th level (3 slots): ice storm*, stoneskin

5th level (2 slots): Bigby's hand*, cone of cold*

6th level (1 slot): chain lightning*, wall of ice*

*Evocation spell

***Sculpt Spells.*** When the evoker casts an evocation spell that forces other creatures it can see to make a saving throw, it can choose a number of them equal to 1+the spell's level. These creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell. If a successful save means a chosen creature would take half damage from the spell, it instead takes no damage from it.

**Actions**

***Quarterstaff.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (1d6-1) bludgeoning damage, or 3 (1d8-1) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands.

***Critter Friend*** 
*(UA: Feats for Races)	Prerequisite: Gnome (Forest)*

**Your friendship with animals mystically deepens. You gain the following benefits:**
• You gain proficiency in the Animal Handling skill. If you’re already proficient in it, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any check you make with it.
• You learn the speak with animals spell and can cast it at will, without expending a spell slot. You also learn the animal friendship spell, and you can cast it once with this feat, without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

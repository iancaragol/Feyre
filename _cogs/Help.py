            !init is a per channel based initiative tracker. 

            Buttons:
                Crossed Swords : Moves turn icon (>).
                Plus Sign : Adds user's active character to initiative, see !help character for details.
                Skull and Crossbones : Removes the user's most recent character from initiative.

            If you need to insert a player into the middle of initative use decimals.

            Commands (can be shortened to !i):
            !init start
                > Starts a new initiative tracker in the same channel, also used to create a new one

            !init [name] [modifier] or [modifier] [name]
                > Adds a player to inititative after rolling 1d20 and applying the modifier.

            Ex:
            !init start

            !i Aragorn 15.1

            '''
            ```
            !character is used to set your active character which is used by the initiative tracker. You can create up to 9 characters and set a character as active using emojis or the command argument [id]. Characters follow you across servers and are persistent.

            This command can also be shortened to !char
            
            Commands:
            !character
                > Shows your character list and lets you select your active character using the UI
            !character -a [Character Name] -i [Initiative Dice Expression]
                > Adds a character with [Character Name] to your character list. [Initiative Dice Expression] will be rolled whenever this character is added to initiative. The -i tag is optional and if it is not included that character's initiative will default to rolling 1d20.
            !character -r [ID]
                > Removes the character with [ID] from your character list. You can find your character's ID's using !character
            !character [ID]
                > Sets the character with [ID] as your active character

            Example:
            !character -a Gandalf -i 1d20-5
            !character
            !character 1
            !character -r 1
            !character -a Frodo

        )

        self.help_str_roll = textwrap.dedent(
            '''
            ```
            !roll can be used to roll dice of any size with complicated expressions and built in skill checks. Press the reroll emoji to reroll that dice expression.

            Dice are represented with the standard [# of dice]d[size of dice] format. You can also use !r.

            Ex: !roll 4d6
            !roll 1d6*2
            !r 1d20 + 5
            !r 1d1000 + 2d2000 * 3 / 3 - 1

            Skill checks can be built into the dice expression using the < and > symbols.
            Ex: !roll 1d20 > 15

            You can roll with advantage or disadvantage using the -a and -d flags before the dice expression.
            Ex: !roll -a 1d20
                !roll -d 1d20+5
            ```
            '''
        )

            '''
            ```
            !d[size] [expression] can be used if you only want to roll one dice.
            This command supports standard dice sizes [4,6,8,10,12,20] and expressions. A space is neccessary between the dice and any modifiers.

            You can also use !dp to roll for percentile.

            Ex:
            !d20
            !d6 +2
            !dp
            ```

            !feat can be used to lookup feats from the Standard Reference Document.

            Why does !feat link to D&D Beyond? Feats are not part of the Standard Reference Document so I cannot display them here.

            Commands:
            !feat [feat name] 
                > Searches for a feat
            !randfeat
                > Gives a random feat

            !feat Keen Mind

            !condition
                > Lists all conditions
            !condition [condition]
                > Gives more info on the specified condition

                > Searches for a monster
            !randmonster
                > Gives a random monster
            Ex:
            !mm Young Black Dragon
            !mm Tarrasque
            !monster Goblin

            '''
            ```
            !class can be used to look up all of the features of a class. This can be a lot of text!


            Ex:
            !c wizard
            !class fighter
            ```

        self.help_str_currency = textwrap.dedent(
            '''
            ```
            !currency can be used to convert any denomination of platinum, gold, electrum, silver, and copper to gold, silver and copper.
            It can also be used to evenly divide an amount of currency between any number of players by including a /x at the end where x is the number of players.

            pp = Platinum
            gp = Gold
            ep = Electrum
            sp = Silver
            cp = Copper

            When providing the amounts there is no need to worry about capitlization or spacing. See the examples below :)

            Commands:
            !currency [amount][abbreviation]
            !currency [amount][abbreviation] / [number of players] <- Optional
            !convert [amount][abbreviation]
            !convert [amount][abbreviation] / [number of players] <- Optional
            !cur [amount][abbreviation]
            !cur [amount][abbreviation] / [number of players] <- Optional

            Ex:
            !currency 10gp 55ep 5sp
            !convert 13gp55pp/4 <- Divides amongst 4 players

            You can use Feyre to manage all of your character's wallets. Your bank is tied to your Discord ID and can be accessed from any server/channel or by direct messaging Feyre.

            Interacting with your bank requires the use of argument flags (-a, -r, -d, -w). If you have any suggestions on how this experience can be streamlined please use the !request command and let me know!

            Commands:
            !bank
                > Shows all of your characters and their unique IDs. The character's id (a unique number representing that character) can be used instead of [character name].

            !bank -r [character name] OR [character id]
                > Deletes the account associated with [character name] or [character id]

            [currency values] have the same format as the !currency command. For example you can represent 10 platinum, 9 gold, 8 electrum, 7 silver, and 6 copper like this: 10pp9gp8ep7sp6cp.

            Examples:
            !bank -a Bilbo

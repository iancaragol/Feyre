## **Features**
## Advanced Dice Rolling üé≤

#### Use *dice expressions* to roll for any scenario
* A die can be represented as [number]d[size]
* An expression is any combination of dice, modifiers, and arithmetic!

#### Roll the same *dice expression* multiple times with the *count* modifier
* Ex: 1d6+3c3 = roll 1 six-sided die and add 3, 3 times independently

#### Use *then* for conditional dice rolls, like checking against AC
* Ex: 1d20+5>15t2d6+4 = roll 1 twenty-sided die and add 5, if that is greater than 15, roll two six-sided die and add 4

#### Use *keep*, *keep-lowest* *explode*, and *explode on* for special rolls, like rolling with advantage!
* Ex: 2d20k1 = roll two twenty-sided die, keep the highest one

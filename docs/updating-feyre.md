# Updating Feyre

**In order to update Feyre on your server follow the steps below**

----

### Step 1

Update Feyre's permissions or invite Feyre back to the server with this [link](http://invite.feyre.io)

You can learn more about each permission and why Feyre needs it [here](permissions-privacy.md)

### Step 2

You should now be able to use slash commands. Checkout all of the new initiative tracker and dice roller [here](commands.md)


### Step 3

If for some reason you cannot use slash commands, try kicking Feyre from the server then inviting it back using the link in Step 1

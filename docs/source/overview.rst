.. _Adding-Feyre:

Add Feyre to your server
========================

You can add Feyre to your server by clicking `here <https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=500733845856059402&scope=bot&permissions=67648>`_. You will need the Manage Server permission in order to do so.

.. _Set-Prefix:

Optional: Change the default prefix
-----------------------------------
By default Feyre using the ! prefix. This may overlap with other bots on your server. If you need to change the default prefix see :ref:`Set-Prefix`.

Feyre is now ready to go! Head over to the :ref:`Commands` section to explore what Feyre is capable of.
